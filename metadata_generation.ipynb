    "In this project, I built a tool that can automatically extract text from `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.txt` files and generate meaningful metadata in JSON format. First, the document text is extracted (using OCR if needed), then it's split into smaller parts. I used a **map-reduce approach** where each part (chunk) is summarized using Gemini AI (map), and then all summaries are combined to create the final metadata (reduce). Finally, I made a user-friendly web app using Gradio where anyone can upload a document and see the metadata instantly.\n",

This behaviour is due to the presence\\nof both acidic (carboxyl group) and basic (amino\\ngroup) groups in the same molecule.

      "This excerpt, seemingly an introduction to a \"Biomolecules\" unit, highlights that living systems, though composed of non-living components, grow, sustain, and reproduce themselves through complex interactions of biomolecules like carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids, emphasizing their role in life processes. The unit will then focus on discussing the structures and functions of some of these molecules.\n",
      "This excerpt, apparently from \"Biomolecules\" Unit 10, outlines the learning objectives related to understanding the characteristics, classification, and roles of biomolecules like carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and hormones, including the difference between DNA and RNA. The excerpt introduces carbohydrates as a prime example of biomolecules produced by plants.\n",
      "Document 10.1 \"Carbohydrates\" explains that while carbohydrates were initially thought to be hydrates of carbon represented by the formula Cx(H2O)y, this definition is inaccurate as some compounds fitting the formula aren't carbohydrates and vice-versa; chemically, they are now defined as optically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones, or compounds that produce these upon hydrolysis.\n",
      "According to the \"Carbohydrates\" reprint 2024-25 document, the sugar we use at home is sucrose.\n",
      "This excerpt from a Chemistry text explains that carbohydrates, also known as saccharides, are classified into three groups (monosaccharides, oligosaccharides) based on their behavior during hydrolysis.\n",
      "This excerpt on carbohydrate hydrolysis explains how disaccharides yield two monosaccharide units (same or different, like sucrose yielding glucose and fructose, and maltose yielding only glucose), and polysaccharides yield many monosaccharide units and are known as non-sugars. Furthermore, it classifies carbohydrates as reducing or non-reducing sugars based on their reactivity with Fehling's solution and Tollens' reagent, noting that all monosaccharides are reducing sugars and are further classified by carbon number.\n",
      "According to \"Classification of Carbohydrates/Monosaccharides\" from the text including Table 10.1, monosaccharides, whether aldoses (containing an aldehyde group) or ketoses (containing a keto group), are reducing sugars and are further classified by the number of carbon atoms they contain.\n",
      "According to section 10.1.2.1 \"Glucose\" from the document \"Preparation of Glucose\" (Reprint 2024-25), glucose is naturally found in fruits and honey and can be prepared from sucrose by boiling it with dilute acids.\n",
      "This excerpt from a document likely titled \"Biomolecules\" describes the production and properties of glucose, including its formation from sucrose and starch hydrolysis, its molecular formula (C6H12O6), and evidence supporting its straight-chain structure and presence of a carbonyl group. The document also notes that Glucose is an aldohexose, also known as dextrose, is a monomer of starch and cellulose and the most abundant organic compound on earth.\n",
      "The excerpt, labeled \"Structure of Glucose Reprint 2024-25,\" details chemical reactions of glucose, specifically reactions with hydroxylamine, hydrogen cyanide, bromine water, and acetic anhydride, to confirm the presence of a carbonyl group (aldehyde) and five hydroxyl groups. These reactions also allow determination of the structure of glucose.\n",
      "In the Chemistry excerpt, page 284, the text describes how oxidation reactions involving nitric acid, glucose, and gluconic acid yield saccharic acid, thus indicating a primary alcoholic group in glucose, and details the correct naming and configurations (D and +) assigned by Fischer, while clarifying that 'D' and 'L' do not directly correlate to optical activity.\n",
      "The excerpt from an unspecified document clarifies that \"D\" and \"L\" notations denote the relative configuration of a stereoisomer compared to a reference compound, specifically glyceraldehyde for carbohydrates, where D(+) glyceraldehyde has the -OH group on the right in a specific structural representation. These \"D\" and \"L\" notations do not correlate with optical activity.\n",
      "This excerpt, \"Reprint 2024-25,\" defines D and L configurations of chemical compounds based on their correlation to D(+) and L(-) isomers of glyceraldehyde, respectively, where the position of the -OH group determines the configuration.\n",
      "According to the \"Biomolecules\" excerpt, the D-configuration of (+) glucose is determined by comparing the orientation of the —OH group on its lowest asymmetric carbon atom to that of (+) glyceraldehyde, even though structure (I) of glucose cannot explain all of its chemical properties, such as its failure to react as a free aldehyde.\n",
      "Glucose's behavior, including its failure to form hydrogensulphite adducts, its pentaacetate's non-reaction with hydroxylamine, and its existence in two crystalline forms (α and β), could not be explained by an open-chain structure and instead indicates a cyclic hemiacetal structure involving the -OH group at C-5, which also explains the existence of these two forms. This cyclic nature, inferred from the described reactions and crystalline structures, resolves the apparent absence of a free -CHO group.\n",
      "According to \"Cyclic Structure of Glucose Reprint 2024-25,\" glucose exists in two cyclic hemiacetal forms that differ only in the configuration of the hydroxyl group at the anomeric carbon (C1) and are in equilibrium with an open chain structure.\n",
      "From the \"Chemistry\" excerpt, the text describes anomers as isomers (alpha and beta forms) formed during cyclization of aldehydes like glucose into pyranose structures, while also detailing fructose as a ketohexose with a ketonic functional group and properties similar to glucose. Fructose has the same molecular formula as Glucose i.e. C6H12O6, and is also Laevorotatory.\n",
      "The excerpt \"10.1.2.2 Fructose\" from \"Reprint 2024-25\" describes the structure of D-(-)-fructose, a ketohexose and laevorotatory compound, focusing on its open-chain structure and cyclic furanose forms resulting from the addition of -OH at C5. The text uses the analogy of furan to describe the five-membered ring formed.\n",
      "From the \"Biomolecules\" excerpt discussing \"Disaccharides,\" section 10.1.3, the text explains that disaccharides are formed from two monosaccharides linked by a glycosidic linkage, and are classified as either reducing or non-reducing sugars depending on whether their aldehydic or ketonic groups are bonded, with sucrose being a non-reducing sugar.\n",
      "The \"Disaccharides\" excerpt from \"Reprint 2024-25\" describes the structure and properties of sucrose, explaining its non-reducing nature due to glycosidic bond formation, and its hydrolysis into invert sugar with a change in optical rotation, also describing the structure of maltose which is a reducing sugar.\n",
      "From the \"Chemistry\" document, the excerpt describes lactose as a milk sugar disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose, and then contrasts it with polysaccharides, specifically starch, which is a storage polysaccharide in plants comprised of glucose polymers like amylose.\n",
      "The text excerpt, \"Amylose and Amylopectin\" (Reprint 2024-25), describes the structures and properties of amylose and amylopectin, the two components of starch, highlighting their differing solubility and glycosidic linkages. The excerpt appears to be from section 10.1.4 regarding Polysaccharides.\n",
      "From the \"Biomolecules\" excerpt, cellulose, found exclusively in plants, is the most abundant organic substance forming plant cell walls, while glycogen, known as animal starch, serves as a glucose storage molecule in animals, yeast, and fungi.\n",
      "According to the \"Importance of Carbohydrates\" document (Reprint 2024-25), carbohydrates, including honey used by 'Vaids' in ayurvedic medicine, are a major food source and function as storage molecules like starch and glycogen, while cellulose forms the cell walls of bacteria and plants and is used to build furniture.\n",
      "The provided excerpt from a Chemistry textbook discusses the importance of carbohydrates and proteins in biological systems, noting their presence in industries like textiles and breweries and their role as raw materials and fundamental components of the body. The text also includes in-text questions (10.1, 10.2, 10.3) and references specific sections from Class XII material (Section 10.5.1).\n",
      "This excerpt describes proteins as essential building blocks for life, highlighting their sources, importance for growth and maintenance, and fundamental chemical structure as polymers of a-amino acids derived from the Greek word \"proteios\" meaning primary. The excerpt further clarifies that a-amino acids are the building blocks obtained when proteins are broken down, noting their diverse properties and naming conventions, such as glycine (sweet) and tyrosine (cheese).\n",
      "Table 10.2, \"Natural Amino Acids\" from section 10.2.1 of \"Proteins\" (Reprint 2024-25) details the names, characteristic features, three-letter symbols, and one-letter codes for common amino acids, highlighting the origin of names like Glycine and Tyrosine. The table provides a reference for understanding the structure and representation of these amino acids.\n",
      "From the \"Biomolecules\" excerpt, numbered 5-20, the text lists amino acids, their structures, abbreviations, and one-letter codes, noting essential amino acids and classifying them based on the ratio of amino and carboxyl groups.\n",
      "According to \"Classification of Amino Acids\" (Reprint 2024-25) section 10.2.2, the relative amounts of amino and carboxyl groups determine the acidity or basicity of amino acids, and amino acids are classified as essential or non-essential based on the body's ability to synthesize them.\n",
      "From the Chemistry textbook (pg. 292), the excerpt explains that amino acids are water-soluble, high-melting, crystalline solids that behave like salts due to their zwitterionic form arising from the presence of both acidic and basic groups, which also gives them amphoteric properties.\n",
      "This excerpt, focusing on L-configuration, explains that proteins are polymers of alpha-amino acids linked by peptide bonds, formed through the reaction of -COOH and -NH2 groups, resulting in the elimination of water and the creation of dipeptides, tripeptides, and longer chains.\n",
      "The excerpt describes the formation of peptides and proteins, explaining how amino acids link to form dipeptides, tripeptides, and larger polypeptides, culminating in proteins containing over 100 amino acids and a molecular mass above 10,000u, although the distinction between polypeptides and proteins isn't sharp. It also introduces the classification of proteins based on their molecular shape into fibrous proteins.\n",
      "According to the \"Structure of Proteins\" section from a reprint dated 2024-25, proteins can be classified by molecular shape, with fibrous proteins being one type characterized by parallel polypeptide chains held together by hydrogen and disulfide bonds, making them generally insoluble in water.\n",
      "From the \"Biomolecules\" excerpt (page 293), the text describes protein structures, highlighting globular proteins and the four levels of structural organization: primary (amino acid sequence), secondary (shape), tertiary, and quaternary. The primary structure, specifically the amino acid sequence, is critical as any change results in a different protein.\n",
      "This excerpt, discussing the secondary structure of proteins, explains that polypeptide chains can exist in two main forms: alpha-helices and beta-pleated sheets, arising from hydrogen bonding within the polypeptide backbone as illustrated in Fig. 10.1.\n",
      "This excerpt from \"Reprint 2024-25\" describes the tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins, explaining that tertiary structure involves the overall folding of polypeptide chains stabilized by various forces, while quaternary structure refers to the spatial arrangement of multiple polypeptide subunits.\n",
      "Based on the \"Chemistry\" excerpt, specifically section 10.2.4 titled \"Denaturation of Proteins\" and referencing Figures 10.3 and 10.4, proteins can lose their biological activity through denaturation caused by physical or chemical changes that disrupt their structure. This reprinted excerpt from 2024-25 illustrates protein structures and the process of denaturation.\n",
      "From the \"Biomolecules\" excerpt (document title unidentified), the text explains protein denaturation, where secondary and tertiary structures are destroyed while the primary structure remains, using examples like egg white coagulation and milk curdling, and then transitions to discussing the coordination of chemical reactions in living organisms.\n",
      "Enzymes, as described in this excerpt, are globular protein biocatalysts that facilitate specific reactions under mild conditions, typically named after their substrate or reaction with an \"-ase\" ending, and required in small quantities. The excerpt also contains visual metadata including page numbers (12, 22, 11, 6) and a chemical equation for the reaction of maltose to glucose catalyzed by maltase.\n",
      "Enzymes, identifiable by the suffix \"-ase,\" act as catalysts by reducing activation energy in reactions, as exemplified by sucrase in sucrose hydrolysis. The text also discusses vitamins as essential organic compounds required in small amounts, primarily obtained from plants or gut bacteria, with deficiencies leading to specific diseases.\n",
      "From the \"Reprint 2024-25\" document on enzymes and vitamins, specifically section \"10.4 Vitamins\" and \"10.3 Enzymes\", the text describes vitamins as organic compounds generally available in the diet, required in small amounts for specific biological functions despite their diverse chemical structures.\n",
      "From the text \"Chemistry,\" excerpted from a document with page number 296, the passage explains that vitamins, essential for organism health and originally named for containing amino groups, are now classified based on their solubility in water or fat, and warns against excessive vitamin intake without medical advice.\n",
      "Water-soluble vitamins, like B group vitamins and vitamin C, are readily excreted and must be regularly supplied through diet, while Table 10.3 (referenced in section 10.4.1 \"Classification of Vitamins\") lists important vitamins, their sources, and associated deficiency diseases, including those addressed by sources like fish liver oil, carrots, yeast, and citrus fruits, which prevent diseases like Xerophthalmia, Beri beri, and Scurvy.\n",
      "Table 10.3, \"Some important Vitamins, their Sources and their Deficiency Diseases,\" (Reprint 2024-25) lists vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C, and D, and associates each with specific deficiency diseases such as cheilosis, convulsions, pernicious anemia, scurvy, rickets, and osteomalacia. The table outlines the relationship between vitamin deficiency and resulting health problems.\n",
      "From the excerpt titled \"Biomolecules\" and implicitly referencing work by \"James Dewey Watson,\" the text describes nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) as essential biomolecules within cell nuclei, responsible for transmitting hereditary characteristics across generations, and also mentions Vitamins E and K, along with their sources and deficiency effects.\n",
      "According to the text excerpt on Nucleic Acids, likely by James Dewey Watson, the discovery of DNA's double helix structure, composed of phosphate, deoxyribose, and base pairs, revolutionized molecular biology by explaining DNA replication. The excerpt mentions polynucleotides as another name for nucleic acids.\n",
      "The \"10.5.1 Chemical Composition of Nucleic Acids\" excerpt, reprinted 2024-25, explains that DNA's nucleotide base pairing enables identical replication, which revolutionized biology, and describes the basic chemical components resulting from complete hydrolysis of DNA/RNA.\n",
      "From the \"Chemistry\" document (Reprint 2024-25), this excerpt describes the composition of DNA and RNA, highlighting the key bases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil) and explaining the formation of nucleosides and nucleotides via linkages to sugar and phosphoric acid. It further explains the phosphodiester linkage between nucleotides, which are illustrated in figures.\n",
      "From the \"Biomolecules\" excerpt, the primary structure of nucleic acids is the nucleotide sequence, while secondary structure in DNA, as discovered by Watson and Crick (Fig. 10.7), involves a double helix with complementary base pairing (Adenine-Thymine, Cytosine-Guanine), and RNA exhibits single-stranded helices and exists in three functional types: mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA.\n",
      "This \"Reprint 2024-25\" excerpt describes RNA molecules, outlining that they are of three types (mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA) with different functions and displaying a diagram of their structure.\n",
      "Based on the Chemistry excerpt from \"300\" by Har Gobind Khorana, DNA fingerprinting, which is a unique and unalterable sequence of bases on DNA, is used for identification purposes in forensics, paternity testing, identifying accident victims, and tracing racial groups. DNA, as the chemical basis of heredity, maintains species identity over millions of years.\n",
      "This excerpt highlights the crucial roles of DNA in preserving species identity through self-duplication and transmitting genetic information, while also detailing how RNA uses DNA's instructions for protein synthesis; it further describes hormones as intercellular messengers, classifying them chemically as steroids, polypeptides, or amino acid derivatives.\n",
      "According to the \"10.5.3 Biological Functions of Nucleic Acids\" excerpt, hormones, including polypeptides like insulin and endorphins and amino acid derivatives like epinephrine and norepinephrine, maintain biological balance in the body, with examples given being insulin and glucagon regulating blood glucose levels, and growth and sex hormones playing roles in development. The excerpt also mentions Har Gobind Khorana, born in 1922, who obtained his M.Sc.\n",
      "Based on the text, \"10.5.3 Biological Functions of Nucleic Acids\" and \"10.6 Hormones\", the excerpt details the scientific background of Har Gobind Khorana, a Nobel laureate for his work on the genetic code, alongside a mention of hormones possibly in the context of a derivative of amino acid tyrosine. It also includes the text \"Reprint 2024-25\".\n",
      "From the \"Biomolecules\" excerpt, the text details thyroid hormone imbalances leading to hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and how iodine supplementation addresses hypothyroidism; it further describes the adrenal cortex's role in producing steroid hormones, where dysfunction can cause Addison's disease.\n",
      "This \"Intext Questions\" excerpt describes Addison's disease and its treatment, along with the roles of testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone in the development of secondary sex characteristics and reproductive processes. It also poses questions related to Vitamin C storage and nucleotide hydrolysis.\n",
      "The \"Intext Questions\" text excerpt presents questions about vitamin C, nucleotide hydrolysis, and RNA structure, followed by a summary that defines carbohydrates as polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones classified into monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides, and proteins as polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, mentioning essential amino acids.\n",
      "This excerpt, likely from a textbook or educational material reprinted in 2024-25, explains that proteins, built from amino acids (some essential), perform structural and dynamic functions and can be denatured, and that enzymes are protein-based biocatalysts; furthermore, it introduces vitamins as essential dietary factors classified by solubility, whose deficiency causes diseases.\n",
      "This excerpt from a Chemistry document, likely a textbook chapter based on the presence of numbered questions (10.1-10.4), explains that nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are nucleotide polymers responsible for genetic transfer, differing in their sugar (deoxyribose vs. ribose), one base (thymine vs. uracil), and structure (double vs. single strand), with DNA carrying the genetic code and RNA types facilitating protein synthesis.\n",
      "This excerpt, \"10.1 - 10.13\", presents a series of questions covering fundamental concepts in carbohydrate and protein biochemistry, including monosaccharides, disaccharides, glycosidic linkages, glycogen, starch, cellulose, glucose reactions, amino acids, protein structure, and denaturation. The document appears to be a set of biochemistry exercises or review questions.\n",
      "This excerpt, likely from a study guide or textbook chapter, presents a series of questions regarding the structure, properties, and functions of proteins, amino acids, enzymes, vitamins, and nucleic acids, including DNA and RNA. The questions cover topics such as peptide linkages, protein structures, denaturation, amphoteric behavior, vitamin classification, and the differences between nucleosides and nucleotides.\n",
      "This excerpt, titled \"Exercises\" and reprinted in 2024-25, presents questions focusing on the complementary nature of DNA strands, structural and functional differences between DNA and RNA, and the types of RNA found in cells. It aims to test understanding of fundamental concepts in molecular biology.\n"

    "# 1. **Text Extraction**: The uploaded file (PDF, DOCX, or TXT) is processed using appropriate libraries like PyMuPDF, python-docx, or built-in file handling. For scanned PDFs, OCR is applied using Tesseract.\n",
    "# 2. **Chunking**: The extracted text is split into overlapping chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to ensure LLM compatibility.\n",
    "# 3. **Async Summarization**: Each chunk is summarized concurrently using Google’s Gemini model (`gemini-2.0-flash`) through asynchronous API calls with a concurrency control mechanism.\n",
    "# 4. **Metadata Generation**: A final LLM prompt combines all summaries and produces structured metadata in JSON format, including details like summary, word count, author, and other contextual elements.\n",
    "# 5. **UI Integration**: The interface is built using Gradio Blocks. It features a file uploader, a trigger button to start processing, and a JSON viewer to display the resulting metadata.\n",
